## Motivation

3D data is prevalent in various domains, such as medical imaging, computer vision, and more. 
Adapting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle 3D data effectively is crucial. 
This repository aims to provide a 3D adaptation of the ResNeXt architecture to address this need.

## Model Architecture

The 3D ResNeXt architecture is based on the original ResNeXt but tailored to process 3D volumes. 
It leverages the concept of cardinality and group convolutions to enhance the model's representational power.

For detailed information about the architecture, please refer to the original paper [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05431.pdf).
## Usage
