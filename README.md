# 3D ResNeXt: ResNeXt but with 3D convolutions

This repository contains code for adapting the ResNeXt architecture to the 3D case. 

## Motivation

3D data is prevalent in various domains, such as medical imaging, computer vision, and more. 
Adapting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle 3D data effectively is crucial. 
This repository aims to provide a 3D adaptation of the ResNeXt architecture.
## Model Architecture

The 3D ResNeXt architecture is based on the original ResNeXt but tailored to process 3D volumes. 

For detailed information about the architecture, please refer to the original paper [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05431.pdf).
## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-ResNeXt.git
cd 3D-ResNeXt
```
Then you can use the 3D-ResNeXt model for your projetcs.
